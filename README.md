# Deterministic-ICA
This repository is for the code of the paper "Deterministic Independent Component Analysis" (http://jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v37/huangb15.html).

Simply run main.m


You will need to install FPCA (https://github.com/yingusxiaous/libFPCA) and FastICA (https://bitbucket.org/szzoli/ite/downloads) for the code to run Fourier PCA and FastICA.
